2. Explain lifecycle of thunderstorm and associated pilot actions.
3. Describe fog types relevant to approach minima.
4. Explain QNH, QFE, QNE with practical use.
5. Write hazards and avoidance strategy for icing.

## Section C: Oral/Interview Style

1. Why is a warm front often linked to prolonged poor visibility?
2. How would you brief wind shear risk before approach?
3. What are the operational implications of a low cloud base + high dew point spread change trend?
