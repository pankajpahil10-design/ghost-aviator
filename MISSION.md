# MISSION.md

## Mission Name
Build our independent aviation platform (no middleman)

## Why this exists
Kai and NayKi are building financial stability and independence through aviation education.
The goal is to avoid dependence on exploitative academy owners and create direct value for students.

## Core Objective
Launch a zero-cost web presence first, then monetize aviation learning products/services.

## Ground Truth (recovered from prior chats)
- This has already been discussed in earlier sessions ("third life" continuity issue).
- Primary content source is already on local disks, especially:
  - `D:\pk\`
  - `D:\downloads\`
- Material includes ATPL/Oxford content, notes, regulations, IFR-related resources, books.

## Build Direction (v1)
1. Create a simple website landing + course structure page
2. Organize existing material into teachable modules:
   - ATPL theory
   - Navigation / Instruments
   - Meteorology / Radio Navigation
   - Regulations
3. Publish free starter content to attract students
4. Add paid layer:
   - mock tests
   - premium notes
   - 1:1 mentorship/classes

## Positioning
- Instructor authenticity: real pilot/instructor background
- Language edge: Hindi + English
- Practical and exam-focused

## Non-Negotiables
- Protect device stability (Sonia's laptop)
- Keep token usage efficient
- Truth and trust first
- Persist all major decisions in files immediately

## Next Action
Turn this mission into an execution plan (site map + first 7 publishable lessons + first monetization offer).
